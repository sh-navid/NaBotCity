<!-- ## SRS Clean Architecture
- Core
    - Contains the business logic
    - Independent of other layers
    - Outer layers depends on abstractions defined in inner layers
- Application
    - Manages data flow between core and other layers
- Infrastructure
    - Implements interfaces defined in core
    - Deals wiht databases, ...
- Presentation
    - UI
    - Controllers/endpoints -->


<!-- ## Credits
This project utilizes the:
- `@react-three/drei` library, which offers useful helpers for building 3D applications with React and Three.js. For more information, visit the [@react-three/drei GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei).
- `@react-three/fiber`, a React renderer for Three.js, allowing for declarative 3D scene building with reusable components. For more information, visit the [@react-three/fiber GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).
- This project utilizes `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`, which are built on top of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a powerful 3D library for creating graphics in the browser.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. For more information, visit the React documentation.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for backend functionalities, Node.js a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side development. For more information, visit the Node.js documentation.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), a library for real-time web applications that enables bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
